<p>Welcome to the Department of Materials Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science.
<br>
While you could take a virtual tour by browsing through the links, we have put together a page for current and prospective students, and another on the mechanisms through which our Department interacts with industries.
<br>
</p>
<h2>Here are a few highlights for the year 2017:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>The Department has over nearly 110 PhD scholars, and about 30 masters students, It also runs, together with the Materials Research Centre, the Materials Stream in the Institute undergraduate program; three batches (2015, 2016, 2017) of students have graduated, and joined the Materials community so far.</li>
	<li>K.P. Abraham Memorial Fund was launched in 2012 with a goal of raising Rs. 2 crores to serve the twin objectives of equipping our new building (see below), and endowing a visiting faculty chair. We have already received generous contributions from our alumni and well wishers. This drive will remain open until the goal is reached.</li>
	<li>The Department now has a new 4-story building with about 25,000 square feet of space for laboratories, and offices.</li>
</ul>
